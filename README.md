# Infinixar

Ye's attempts

Pitch: Somthing like a CoreXY printer, with extending y axis dimensions. Currently the 180x180x180 build size of my bambu mini a1 is very restrivie so I wanna build somthing with a infinitly improvable y axis grid.

build size like:
125x?x125

Links Iâ€™ve gathered so far:

Like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek_7tBOCcAI&t=515s&ab_channel=SunShine
But instead of self-extending build volume which is way to hard, imma make a stackable version that requires external parts to reinforce the structures to avoid the problem that happen in the video.
