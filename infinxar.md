# Infinixar

Ye's attempts

Pitch: Somthing like a CoreXY printer, with extending y axis dimensions. Currently the 180x180x180 build size of my bambu mini a1 is very restrivie so I wanna build somthing with a infinitly improvable y axis grid.

## Planning
build size like 125x?x125
Core-xy design
Klipper run on a Raspberry Pi 4B
toolhead(idk? need more reasearch)

But instead of self-extending build volume which is way to hard, imma make a stackable version that requires external parts to reinforce the structures to avoid the problem that happen in the video.

### Progress Log
Spent like 10 hours reasearching different parts needed, and learning how a printer works. However I am starting to have doubts if I can make it with my current funds. Maybe a custom cartesian 3d printer will have been better? Oh well
